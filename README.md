# Makefile-loading-bar
Part of a makefile featuring a customized loading bar using ANSI

This is actually my first time creating a Makefile with customized ANSI sequences and loading bar, I tried doing something more complex but in the end I understood that more complex doesn't mean better, so I decided to stick with the loading bar that I created something like 5 hours before, and I have to stay I have no regret in doing so.
